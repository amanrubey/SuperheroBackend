# If I had more time

## Future Enhancements 🚀

If I had more time, I would have implemented the following features:

- **Multiple Superpowers**: A single user could enter multiple superpowers instead of just one!
- **City Field**: Users would be able to add their city information.
- **AI-Suggested Humility Score**: Based on the inputted superpower, an AI model would suggest a humility score.
- **Enhanced List Component**: Improve the UI/UX for a more visually appealing superhero list.
- **Category-Based Filtering**: Users could filter superheroes based on their humility scores.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.
- **Delete Superheroes Feature**: Provide users with the option to remove superheroes.
- **Improved Filter Power Button UI**: Enhance the design and usability of the filter power button.
- **Make the codebase modular**: by having components in separate folder.
- **Place pic**: Place pic of the superpower on right end of card.

## Existing Issues & Bugs 🐞

These are the existing issues I planned to solve:

- **Sort Button Bug**: The sort button does not work properly for categories.
- **Rendering Issue**: After a few toggles between power categories, selecting 'All Powers' does not render anything.

## A Personal Note 📝

I really wanted to add testing features, but unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to learn much about testing yet. My current company uses an outdated tech stack (Django, HTML, CSS, jQuery), which has limited my exposure to modern testing methodologies. However, I’m deeply passionate about **React.js, Next.js, and Node.js**, and I would love to explore more about how things are actually built using these frameworks and also best practices and testing.

While my **Next.js skills were strong**, they have become a little rusty due to my jam packed work schedule. That said, I’m confident that I can pick it up again quickly!
